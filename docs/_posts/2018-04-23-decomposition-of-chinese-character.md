# Decompisition of Chinese Characters
We would like to trace the evolution of the components of any modern character back to its original logical components. 
We wish to creat a standard formal linguistic form for describing any character.

# Character-standard-name 

Every character has a standard name so it is referenced exactly the same nomatter where it is used. 
The character name should describe what the character means in general and
what the original pictograph was and the basic pronunciation.
The words are separated by "-" so they appere to the computer to be one word.

examples:

金 = metal-bell-jin 

This tells the basic meaning, the original pictograph, a bell which represents metal, and its basic pronunciation, "jin".

土 = potters-clay-tu 

A lump of clay on a potters wheel originally represented any dirt, earth, or land.

# Character-standard-reference

All character components are referenced by three parts. 
A character-standard-name, character(s), pinying pronunciation.

example: 

metal-bell-jin 钅釒金 jīn

In this example I have three characters 钅釒金 which I consider to be "exact equivalents" 

# #Compound and #Component
If in the modern character, you can draw a line between two or more logical parts it is called a compound.
If the modern character can not be broken into two or more parts then it is a component. 
By components, I mean basic modern components, not primitive components. 

example: 

Compound 菇

because it can be broken into 艹 and 姑

Component 先 

I call this a component, because, without knowledge of its older forms, you can not draw a line between two or more logical components. 

I have analyzed about 15,000 different characters and come up with about 900 modern basic modern components. 
Many of these modern components are actually compounds if you look at earlier versions. 

# Rennants #rem- and #rem+

A large percentage of modern characters have aparent components that are actually logically wrong representations of earlier logically corredt components. They are in fact mistakes. I refere to these as rem-.

example: 

Compound 肚

from (rem- 月 yuè) from 

ribs-rou ⺼肉 ròu and 

phonetic potters-clay-tu 土 tǔ.


Some remnants are not mistakin characters, but indicate some meaningful part of the original pictograph. I represent this with a rem+

example:

Component 天

from person-stand-da 大 dà and 

(rem+ 一 yī sky-above-man).

(name- sky-heaven-tian 天 tiān)

# #phonetic and #related phonetic
Sometimes a character component acts as a phonetic. 

Compound 肚

from (rem- 月 yuè) from 

ribs-rou ⺼肉 ròu and 

phonetic potters-clay-tu 土 tǔ.

Sometimes the phonetic may also be related in meaning. 

Compound 葉

from grass-cao 艹艸 cǎo and 

related phonetic leaf-ye 枼 yè.

# etymogical equivalents #older 
报報𡙈 are in fact evolved forms of a single character. I use the key word #older  

example:

Compound 報 older 𡙈 

from (rem- 扌 shǒu) from 

(rem- 幸 xìng) from 

hand-cuffs-nie 㚔 niè and 

to-regulate-fu 𠬝 fú

new-char 报.

# logical equivalents #variant 


# Simplification #std-var #new-char #simp
Simplifying a traditional character may involve 4 steps
1) apply any vairint character rule. This may result in a standard variant that is 




# #reduced 
example:

Compound 篾

from bamboo-zhu 𥫗竹 zhú and 

reduced phonetic disdain-mie 蔑 miè.
