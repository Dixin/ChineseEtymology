# Decompisition of Chinese Characters
We would like to trace see the components any modern character back to its original logical components. 

Simplified to Traditional (how was the simplified character derived)

# Character-standard-name 

Every character has a standard name so it is referenced exactly the same nomatter where it is used. 
The character name should describe what the character means in general and
what the original pictograph was and the basic pronunciation.
The words are separated by "-" so they appere to the computer to be one word.

examples:

金 = metal-bell-jin 

This tells the basic meaning, the original pictograph, a bell which represents metal, and its basic pronunciation, "jin".

土 = potters-clay-tu 

A lump of clay on a potters wheel originally represented any dirt, earth, or land.

# Character-standard-reference

All character components are referenced by three parts. 
A character-standard-name, character(s), pinying pronunciation.

example: 

metal-bell-jin 钅釒金 jīn

In this example I have three characters 钅釒金 which I consider to be "exact equivalents" 

# Compounds and Components
If in the modern character, you can draw a line between two or more logical parts it is called a compound.
If it can not be broken into two or more parts then it is a component. By components, I mean basic modern components, not primitive components. 

example: 

Compound 菇

because it can be broken into 艹 and 姑

Component 先 

I call this a component, because, without knowledge of its older forms, you can not draw a line between two or more logical components. 

I have analyzed about 15,000 different characters and come up with about 900 modern basic components. Many of these modern components are actually compounds if you look at earlier versions.
